**A pure, ultra-lightweight native web browser. Zero Electron bloat. Just metal-level speed.**

The modern web is infested with heavy JavaScript wrappers (like Electron) that consume massive amounts of RAM and drain battery life. **Titanium Core v1.0** strips all of that away. Built completely natively for iPadOS using Swift and Apple's advanced WebKit engine, this is a high-performance daily driver designed for power users who demand instant rendering and fluid gestures.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

1. **Native Dominance:** No Python wrappers, no `pip install`, and no web-based UI. We use pure SwiftUI to communicate directly with the iPad's hardware.
2. **Micro-Footprint:** Built to consume the absolute minimum amount of RAM. By using native Apple frameworks, Titanium Core keeps your tabs alive without crashing your device.
3. **Agent-Ready (The "Manus" Protocol):** While it operates as a lightweight daily driver, the core architecture includes a JavaScript bridge designed to seamlessly integrate with autonomous AI agents in the future.

**2. Open the Engine:**
Locate the `TitaniumCore.swiftpm` folder and open it using the **Swift Playgrounds** app on your iPad.

**3. Launch the Browser:**
Tap the **Play/Run** button inside Swift Playgrounds. The app will compile instantly and launch the Titanium Core interface.
